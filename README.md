This pack was created by Scavager's community comments and he modeled everything himself which took hours of work with some items.
Please do not re-distribute this pack unless given permission by Scavager, although you are allowed to create a seperate private pack with these models as long as they don't end up on the internet.

#Info about the pack:
Most of the models have pvp showcases that can be found on this YouTube Channel(https://youtube.com/Scavagermc)

#PLEASE NOTE:
Some models may have additional .properties files so they can also be an item, take the hammer for example yes it is the same model from this video(https://youtu.be/LZ_Yr7hvJY0) but to actually get the axe you must name it to Hammer.
